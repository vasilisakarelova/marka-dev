MARKA brought Marina Abramovich and Madonna to Moscow for the first time, launched the first Moscow exhibitions of architect Norman Foster and director Robert Wilson, arranged the first Russian lectures by Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and Viktor & Rolf designers, hosted a show by Vivienne Westwood, and ran a vintage print auction at the Terry O'Neill and Terry Gilliam photo exhibition. The success of these meetings showed how much Muscovites are interested in the format \u2014 to observe and participate in public discussions with international stars. For example, 3000 people attended the lecture given by Norman Foster, instead of 1000 who received registration, and the hall and balconies of the capacious \u201cRossiya\u201d cinema were packed by the audience of Marina Abramovich\u2019s performance.","slider":[{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/2.jpg","desc":"Jimmy Wales"},{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/b6f75c9d3091a57146395e02c6d9fac54891bf38.jpg","desc":"Marina Abramovi\u0107"},{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/wilson.jpg","desc":"Robert Wilson"},{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/westwood.jpg","desc":"Vivienne Westwood"},{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/norman-foster-999999-19.jpg","desc":"Norman Foster"},{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/victor-rolf.jpg","desc":"Rolf Snoeren (Victor & Rolf) and Alyona Doletskaya"},{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/klein.jpg","desc":"Steven Klein"},{"url":"https:\/\/marka.moscow\/admin\/content\/1-projects\/15-main-heroes\/terry.jpg","desc":"Terry O'Neill"}]}}],"tags":["exhibitions","public art","events","festivals"],"about":{"intro":"<p>MARKA is a production company for the arts and modern culture.<\/p>\n<p>For 25 years, we have been using modern art and culture as a tool to fulfill commercial marketing and promotional tasks and to enhance social projects.
